This is a very simple Obsidian plugin (literally 22 lines) that makes it so that when you click on a link to a note that doesn't exist yet, the note is created in the same folder that your active note is in. You can still use the default behaviour via the context menu.

To install, clone this repo into `.obsidian/plugins` in your vault, then enable the plugin in settings under `Community plugins`.
